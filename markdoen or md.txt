*Markdown is a language that formats your text into headers spacings etc, like what word does but using code

*headers = # <your text> (this will create the largest header the more Asterix you place the smaller the header, so a sub header would be ##)
*md files are used as README files in github

*Here is a cheat sheet for codes in md
