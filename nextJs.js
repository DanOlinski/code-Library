//This is a react framework, having a traditional react application means that the page will be rendered in the browser. The issue with this is that bots (google, and social media apps) can't read your website making it not SEO friendly. next.js pre renders your page on the server so that bots can read it and since the page is pre rendered it also loads faster in the client side.
