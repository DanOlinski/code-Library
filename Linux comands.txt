*Virtual Machine (VM)
-for you to work in a virtual machine you need to have a text file inside a folder that will link you to a machine. You`ll also need a program to run the VM on like VirtualBox. You`ll also need a program that will manage the synchronization between your VM and the server and a folder in your PC that mirrors the files you create in the server for example vagrant
-go into your VM folder/vagrant up/vagrant ssh =acsesslghthouse VM.
-logout = To log out simply type logout
-touch = creates a file in a virtual machine example: touch test_file.txt
You have to be logged into a virtual machine to do this
-vagrant halt = shuts down the virtual machine (you need to be inside the folder your VM is running under
-vagrant status = checks if your VM is onof off
-to navigate into a directory from within the vagrant machine
When you are in a VM it is running from within a folder, that folder is considered the cd. So for example if the VM folder is called �VMfolder� and in it there is a folder called �newDir� to go into that newDirgolder you type into the comand line: cd newDir
If you want to go back 1 folter type cd -
-To reset machine back to factory mode go to virtualbox and delete the virtual machine in question. Then run vagrant up (this will download the machine from scratch) then run the machine using vagran ssh

*mkdir=create new folder

*node = this comand runs a js or html etc coding file, you run it by typing: node filePath.extenssion
If you run node command on it`s own it`ll open space for you to code right into the terminal
-you'll need to install npm(node package) and nvm(node version manager, allows you to change back and forth between node versions)

sudo apt npm install

+To install nvm in older versions of Ubuntu (older than version 20)
sudo apt nvm install

+to install nvm in versions of Ubuntu 20 or higher
sudo apt install curl
paste on terminal: curl https://raw.githubusercontent.com/creationix/nvm/master/install.sh | bash
paste on terminal: source ~/.bashrc

nvm use <16.0.0> (this switches to the node version you specify)
nvm ls shows you all the versions installed
nvm instal 16 (this will install a specific version of nvm, however version some in the following number structure: 16.x.x, but when installing a version only type the 1st digits, otherwise it won't run)

-Depending on the version of linux you have you can't use nvm versions higher than v16. To fix that you'll need to upgrade your Ubuntu
sudo apt update
sudo apt upgrade
sudo apt dist-upgrade
REBOOT YOUR PC
sudo apt purge snapd
sudo apt install update-manager-correct
sudo do-release-upgrade

then you can check your Ubuntu version by typing the command; lsb_release -a (you should expect a version 20 or grater)

*Ruby:
just like above there is a rvm
rvm list will show you all installed versions
