*Types of programming
-Procedural programming: seperate code programs into functions that operate on data
-Obeject oriented programming: seperate code into objects, where functions are called methods and variables are called properties

*Vocab
-properties: variables
-methods: functions
-attributes: methods and properties
-objects: basically the same as attributes, any instance inside a class

*4 pillars of OOP
-Encapsulation
to group methods and properties into a class

-Abstraction
make some methods and properties non accessable when calling the content of an object
these are called private methoods and properties

-Inheritance
you can crate a class that enherits another class that already has objects that you want to use in your new class

-Polymorphism
when creating an object in a class, the objects must be dynamic, for example the value of a variable should be able to be changed when the class is invoked in the main app.
